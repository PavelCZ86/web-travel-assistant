                <h2>What we do</h2>
                <p>Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are scattered all over this planet; you just
                    need to know where to find them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca
                    Trail are out there, waiting for you to walk all over them. We’re proud of our record of successful
                    ascents (over 92% of our travellers make it to the top of Kili, depending on the route), but it’s
                    our CEOs and local guides that make the journey itself as memorable as the summit. And if you’re not
                    into big climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks and iconic treks you’ll love,
                    too.</p>

                    <p>She has booked two major European trips for us in the past year and every aspect has met, and
                        in most cases exceeded, our expectations. Best prices, best hotels, best itineraries, and
                        best cruises, she does it all. But the most important thing is she remembers the little
                        things that we would do if we were making the plans ourselves.</p>

                    <p>Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for about 20 years and there is no one
                        else I would trust to arrange my trips and tours. I've also had great fun on a few of the
                        group trips she has arranged - Peru & Machu Picchu and a 10-day cruise out of Venice and
                        diving. It's always an eclectic group of well traveled, interesting people.</p>
